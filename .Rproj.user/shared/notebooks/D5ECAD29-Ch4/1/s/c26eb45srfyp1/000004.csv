WARNING: Fitting splines and a linear function to a feature introduces a model identifiability problem
         which can cause p-values to appear significant when they are not.

WARNING: p-values calculated in this manner behave correctly for un-penalized models or models with
         known smoothing parameters, but when smoothing parameters have been estimated, the p-values
         are typically lower than they should be, meaning that the tests reject the null too readily.
